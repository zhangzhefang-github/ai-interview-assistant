# Secrets / Local configs
# docker-compose uses the root .env file to substitute variables in the compose file.
# It should not be ignored by Docker CLI if docker-compose needs to process it before passing to engine.
# However, we definitely don't want .env files copied INTO images.
# This .dockerignore affects the build context sent to the Docker daemon.
# If .env is needed by 'docker-compose build' to resolve ARG in Dockerfile, don't list it.
# But it's better to pass secrets via 'environment' in docker-compose.yaml.
# So, we can ignore .env variants to prevent them from entering build context.
